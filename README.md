## 1. Door pull adaptor

**Hypothesis**

**_There's no good reason why all doors shouldn't be 'contactless' or at least minimal contact._** 

-> As a first step, focus on high traffic doors where the majority of traffic for a building passes through. 

**An example:**

1. My apartment block is in a courtyard with a front gate where 3 blocks of people pass through requiring a pull handle to exit (~150 people - high traffic)
2. My actual block (~25 flats) has an entrance door - entering the requires a pull handle (~40 people - medium traffic).
3. Then there's either the lift - press buttons (~ 30 people - medium traffic) or stairs - requires at least one pull handle (~10 people - low traffic).
4. Then my front door which is a more complicated twist handle (very low traffic i.e. only me).

**Other examples:**

- Most modern indoor fire doors will have a pull handle in one direction - start looking around you.
- Most people use the same door to the toilets in an office. 
- Lots of shops have a pull door to exit.

**Existing solutions**

- Automatic doors 
- Foot pull doors e.g. https://www.stepnpull.co.uk/
- Alternative arm door handle e.g. https://www.akitchen.com/store/hands-free-sanitary-door-opener.html

**Criticism of existing solutions**

- Automatic doors are ideal but are expensive and hassle to retrofit if not already in place. It's unfeasible that every door can be automatic.
- Both foot and alternative arm doors are pretty expensive and require permanent and strong fixings to the door. Great if you own the building, but might be a problem to install quickly, temporarily or at scale.
